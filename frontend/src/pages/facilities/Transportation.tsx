              Siddhartha School is committed to providing safe, reliable, and convenient transportation services to students residing in and around Butwal. Our well-maintained fleet of buses ensures timely pick-up and drop-off, making the daily commute stress-free for both students and parents.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">
              To avail transportation, students must register as bus-users in the schoolâ€™s accounts section prior to the commencement of service. This registration process allows us to efficiently manage routes and ensure capacity is sufficient for all passengers.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">
              Students who wish to discontinue transportation services are required to notify the accounts department in advance to avoid unnecessary charges. This helps maintain accurate records and facilitates smooth administrative processes.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-lg">
              For students relocating to a new residence, changes to bus routes and stops can be accommodated upon official notification and record updates. Please note that transfers between bus routes are not permitted unless a change of address justifies such a request. This policy ensures fairness and consistency in service management.
